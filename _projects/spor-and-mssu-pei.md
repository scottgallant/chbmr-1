# SPOR and MSSU PEI

The CHCR is proud to be a part of a Maritime SPOR SUPPORT Unit (MSSU), a specialized, multidisciplinary research service centre that aims to provide the necessary and often highly specialized methodological expertise to those engaged in patient-orientated research. The goal of the MSSU is to efficiently use scarce resources so that stakeholders can better address critical health issues in patient-orientated and health services research.

Patient-orientated research refers to a continuum of research such as initial studies in humans and comparative effectiveness and outcomes research. It also includes the integration of this research into a health care system and clinical practice. The goal of patient orientated research is to better ensure the translation of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the point of care, and to assist the Maritime provinces to meet the challenges of delivering high-quality, cost-effective health care. Under the direction and funding of MSSU, the CHCR is developing a Secure Island Data Repository within UPEI and is also conducting two demonstration projects on hip/knee replacement surgeries and breast cancer research, respectively.

The Director of the CHCR, Dr. Juergen Krause, is one of the leaders of the SPOR (Strategies for Patient Orientated Research) PEI unit. This sub-section of SPOR Canada aligns with SPOR initiatives to advance Patient Orientated Research and improve Canada’s healthcare system.
